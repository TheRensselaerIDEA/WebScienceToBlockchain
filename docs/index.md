# Web Science To Blockchain


Just like the Web in the early nineties, blockchain technologies are now going through a ten-twenty year advancement phase. There are many similarities between the Web and the blockchain: they are both disruptive technologies that have gained colossal user adoption through open architectures that promote a giant connected component and are hard to quantify because of their massive scale.  We are starting to see a lot of public data generated through social interactions in blockchain-based decentralized applications. Therefore, much like the Web, we will start seeing the need for the next generation of scientists informed by methodologies that are similar to the ones used in Web Science to study such ecosystems. However, there are some challenges, as gathering the data from truly decentralized ecosystems such as those powered by the blockchain can be problematic. On the other hand, data sharing using the blockchain will lead to much more transparent and accountable research practices due to the immutable ledger used for data sharing transactions, which will, in turn, promote good data stewardship. 

We will outline our analysis of applying methodologies tried and tested in understanding the Web to understand the communities that are emerging on blockchain based eco-systems.
